FinOps hubs uses Cost Management exports to import cost data for the billing accounts and subscriptions you want to monitor. You can either configure Cost Management exports manually or grant FinOps hubs access to manage exports for you.

<blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
  _Microsoft Cost Management does not support managed exports for Microsoft Customer Agreement billing accounts. Please [configure Cost Management exports manually](#Ô∏è-configure-exports-manually)._
</blockquote>

For the most seamless experience, we recommend allowing FinOps hubs to manage exports for you when possible. This is the simplest to setup and requires the least effort to maintain over time. We only recommend configuring Cost Management exports manually if you cannot grant FinOps hubs access to manage exports for you.

<br>

## üîê Configure managed exports

Managed exports allow FinOps hubs to setup and maintain Cost Management exports for you. To enable managed exports, you must grant Azure Data Factory access to read data across each scope you want to monitor.

| Scope type            | Minimum required permissions |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| EA enrollment         | Enterprise Reader            |
| EA department         | Department Reader            |
| EA enrollment account | Not supported<sup>1</sup>    |
| MPA billing account   | Not supported<sup>1</sup>    |
| MPA customer          | Not supported<sup>1</sup>    |
| MCA billing account   | Not supported<sup>1</sup>    |
| MCA billing profile   | Not supported<sup>1</sup>    |
| MCA invoice section   | Not supported<sup>1</sup>    |
| Management group      | Not supported<sup>2</sup>    |
| Subscription          | Cost Management Contributor  |
| Resource group        | Cost Management Contributor  |

<sup>1) Scope does not support managed exports. Please [configure exports manually](#Ô∏è-configure-exports-manually).</sup><br>
<sup>2) Scope not supported by FinOps hubs. Please enable each subscription separately.</sup><br>

1. **Grant access to Azure Data Factory.**

   - From the FinOps hub resource group, navigate to **Deployments** > **hub** > **Outputs**, and make note of the values for **managedIdentityId** and **managedIdentityTenantId**. You'll use these in the next step.
   - Use the following guides to assign access to each scope you want to monitor:
     - EA enrollments ‚Äì [Assign enrollment reader role permission](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/assign-roles-azure-service-principals#assign-enrollment-account-role-permission-to-the-spn).
     - EA departments ‚Äì [Assign department reader role permission](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/assign-roles-azure-service-principals#assign-enrollment-account-role-permission-to-the-spn).
     - Subscriptions and resource groups ‚Äì [Assign Azure roles using the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal).

    <!--
    ### Enterprise agreement billing accounts and departments
   
    1. [Find your enrollment (and department) Id](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/view-all-accounts#switch-billing-scope-in-the-azure-portal).
    2. Load the FinOps Toolkit PowerShell module.
    3. Grant reader permissions to the data factory
   
       ```powershell
       # Grants enrollment reader permissions to the specified service principal or managed identity
       Add-FinOpsServicePrincipal `
         -ObjectId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 ` # Object Id of data factory managed identity
         -TenantId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 ` # Azure Active Directory tenant Id
         -BillingAccountId 12345                          # Enrollment ID
   
       # Grants department reader permissions to the specified service principal or managed identity
       Add-FinOpsServicePrincipal `
         -ObjectId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 ` # Object Id of data factory managed identity
         -TenantId 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 ` # Azure Active Directory tenant Id
         -BillingAccountId 12345 `                        # Enrollment Id
         -DepartmentId 67890                              # Department Id
        ```
    -->

2. **Add the desired scopes.**

   1. From the FinOps hub resource group, open the storage account and navigate to **Storage browser** > **Blob containers** > **config**.
   2. Select the **settings.json** file, then select **‚ãØ** > **View/edit** to open the file.
   3. Update the **scopes** property to include the scopes you want to monitor. See [Settings.json scope examples](#settingsjson-scope-examples) for details.
   4. Select the **Save** command to save your changes. FinOps hubs should process the change within a few minutes and data should be available within 30 minutes or so, depending on the size of your account.

   <blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
     _Do not add duplicate or overlapping scopes as this will lead to duplication of data._
   </blockquote>

3. **Backfill historical data.**

   As soon as you configure a new scope, FinOps hubs will start to monitor current and future costs. To backfill historical data, you must run the **msexports_backfill** pipeline.

   To run the pipeline from the Azure portal:

   1. From the FinOps hub resource group, open the Data Factory instance, select **Launch Studio**, and navigate to **Author** > **Pipelines** > **msexports_backfill**.
   2. Select **Debug** in the command bar to run the pipeline. The total run time will vary depending on the retention period and number of scopes you're monitoring.

   To run the pipeline from PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   Get-AzDataFactoryV2 `
     -ResourceGroupName "{hub-resource-group}" `
     -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue `
   | ForEach-Object {
       Invoke-AzDataFactoryV2Pipeline `
         -ResourceGroupName $_.ResourceGroupName `
         -DataFactoryName $_.DataFactoryName `
         -PipelineName 'msexports_backfill'
   }
   ```

### Settings.json scope examples

- EA billing account

  ```json
  "scopes": [
    {
      "scope": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/1234567"
    }
  ]
  ```

- EA department

  ```json
  "scopes": [
    {
      "scope": "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/1234567/departments/56789"
    }
  ]
  ```

- Subscription

  ```json
  "scopes": [
    {
      "scope": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
    }
  ]
  ```

- Resource group

  ```json
  "scopes": [
    {
      "scope": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/ftk-finops-hub"
    }
  ]
  ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Configure exports via PowerShell

1. Install the FinOps toolkit PowerShell module.

   ```powershell
   Import-Module -Name FinOpsToolkit
   ```

2. Create the export and run it now to backfill up to 12 months of data.

   ```powershell
   New-FinopsCostExport -Name 'ftk-FinOpsHub-costs' `
     -Scope "{scope-id}" `
     -StorageAccountId "{storage-resource-id}" `
     -Backfill 12 `
     -Execute
   ```

<br>

## üõ†Ô∏è Configure exports manually

If you cannot grant permissions for your scope, you can create Cost Management exports manually to accomplish the same goal.

1. [Create a new FOCUS cost export](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/tutorial-export-acm-data?tabs=azure-portal) using the following settings:

   <!-- TODO: Replace the portal link with the docs link when exports v2 docs are available. -->

   - **Type of data** = `Cost and usage details (FOCUS)`
     <blockquote class="important" markdown="1">
       _FinOps hubs 0.2 requires FOCUS cost data. While FOCUS is fully supported, the option to export FOCUS cost data from Cost Management is currently in preview and has not rolled out to everyone yet. In order to create and manage FOCUS exports, please use the [Exports preview link](https://aka.ms/exportsv2)._
     </blockquote>
   - **Dataset version** = `1.0-preview(v1)`
   - **Frequency** = `Daily export of month-to-date costs`
     <blockquote class="tip" markdown="1">
       _Configuring a daily export starts in the current month. If you want to backfill historical data, create a one-time export and set the start/end dates to the desired date range._
     </blockquote>
   - **File partitioning** = On
   - **Overwrite data** = Off
     <blockquote class="note" markdown="1">
       _While most settings are required, overwriting is optional. We recommend **not** overwriting files so you can monitor your ingestion pipeline using the [Data ingestion](../power-bi/data-ingestion.md) report. If you do not plan to use that report, please enable overwriting._
     </blockquote>
   - **Storage account** = (Use subscription/resource deployed with your hub)
   - **Container** = `msexports`
   - **Directory** = (Use the resource ID of the scope<sup>1</sup> you're exporting without the first "/")
     - _**Billing account:** `providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}`_
     - _**Billing profile:** `providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}/billingProfiles/{billingProfileId}`_
     - _**Department:** `providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}/departments/{departmentId}`_

2. Create another export with the same settings except set **Export type** to `Monthly export of last month's costs`.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 except set **Metric** to `Actual cost`.
4. Run your exports to initialize the dataset.
   - Exports can take up to a day to show up after first created.
   - Use the **Run now** command at the top of the Cost Management Exports page.
   - Your data should be available within 15 minutes or so, depending on how big your account is.
5. Repeat steps 1-4 for each scope you want to monitor.

_<sup>1) A "scope" is an Azure construct that contains resources or enables purchasing services, like a resource group, subscription, management group, or billing account. The resource ID for a scope will be the Azure Resource Manager URI that identifies the scope (e.g., "/subscriptions/###" for a subscription or "/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/###" for a billing account). To learn more, see [Understand and work with scopes](https://aka.ms/costmgmt/scopes).</sup>_
